##  Spotify clone with full-stack functionality

### 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a Spotify Song Dataset Analyser, leveraging a publicly available dataset of top Spotify tracks (1998–2020). The tool cleans, filters, and stores song data in an SQLite database, then performs various analyses, including:

✅ Genre-based statistics for a given year

✅ Artist popularity comparisons across genres

✅ Top 5 artist ranking within a user-defined timeframe

✅ Visualizations using Matplotlib

The dataset includes details such as song title, artist, duration, popularity, danceability, energy, and genre, enabling insights into musical trends.

## 🔍 Dataset Description

The dataset, songs.csv, consists of 2000 top Spotify tracks between 1998 and 2020, including:

🔹 Column Name:	Description

🔹 song:	Song title

🔹 artist:	Artist name

🔹 duration:	Song length (seconds)

🔹 year	Release: year

🔹 popularity:	Popularity score (0-100)

🔹 danceability: Danceability metric (0-1)

🔹 energy:	Energy level (0-1)

🔹 speechiness:	Spoken word percentage (0-1)

🔹 genre:	Genre classification





## 🛠 Features and Functionality

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Storage (CW_Preprocessing.py)

🔹 Loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

🔹 Renames and formats columns (e.g., duration_ms → duration in seconds)

🔹 Filters data:

🔹	Popularity >50 (focus on recognized tracks)

🔹	Speechiness between 0.33 and 0.66 (moderate speech content)

🔹	Danceability >0.20 (tracks with rhythm)

🔹 Stores cleaned data into SQLite database (CWDatabase.db)



### 2. Genre-Based Analysis (Genres.py)

🔹 User inputs a year (1998-2020) 

🔹 Retrieves records for that year from SQLite

🔹 Computes average danceability, total songs, and popularity per genre

🔹 Displays results in a table

🔹 Generates a pie chart visualization using Matplotlib




### 3. Artist Popularity Analysis (Artist.py)

🔹 User inputs an artist’s name

🔹 Fetches the artist’s average song popularity per genre

🔹 Compares it to overall genre popularity

🔹 Highlights genres where the artist is above average

🔹 Generates a bar chart comparing artist vs. overall genre popularity



### 4. Top 5 Artists Ranking (Top5.py)

🔹 User inputs start and end year

🔹 Retrieves songs released in that period

🔹 Calculates ranking value (e.g., Songs Count × Weight + Avg. Popularity × Weight)

🔹 Displays Top 5 artists, highlighting yearly leaders

🔹 Generates a line chart for ranking trends over time
